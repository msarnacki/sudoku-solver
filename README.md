# Sudoku solver

The plan for building this script:
- [x] defining function which checks if putting certain number in certein position is possible
- [ ] building mechanism which is gonna put first possible value in empty position (probably starting from left upper corner and going right and down)
- [ ] if putting no number will be possible in certain place go one place back and try potting next number there and do it untill every position will be correctly filled
